-- Compact regions written to handles this way are subject to some
-- restrictions:
--
--  * Our binary representation contains direct pointers to the info
--    tables of objects in the region.  This means that the info tables
--    of the receiving process must be laid out in exactly the same
--    way as from the original process; in practice, this means using
--    static linking, using the exact same binary and turning off ASLR.  This
--    API does NOT do any safety checking and will probably segfault if you
--    get it wrong.  DO NOT run this on untrusted input.
--
--  * You must read out the value at the correct type.  We will
--    check this for you and raise an error if the types do not match
--    (this is what the 'Typeable' constraint is for).
